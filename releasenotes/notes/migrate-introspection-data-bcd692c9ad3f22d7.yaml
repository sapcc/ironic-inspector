    Adds a migration tool ``ironic-inspector-migrate-data`` to facilitate the
    introspection data migration between supported introspection data storage
    backends. Currently the available introspection data storage backends are:
    ``database`` and ``swift``. For example, to migrate existing introspection
    data stored in the swift to database, execute following command:

    .. code-block:: shell

       $ ironic-inspector-migrate-data --from swift --to database --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf

    Storage backends involved in the migration should have been properly
    configured in the ironic inspector configuration file. Before the
    introspection data migration can be started. The ironic inspector database
    should be upgraded to have the latest schema.
