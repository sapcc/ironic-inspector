    Added the capability to define a scope for the inspection process.
    Previously, all introspection rules were applied when inspecting
    any node. There was no mechanism to apply only a selected set of
    rules. This change introduces a ``scope`` field to introspection rules.
    If a scope is set on an introspection rule, it will only apply to nodes
    that have a matching ``inspection_scope`` property. If not set, it will
    apply to all nodes.
