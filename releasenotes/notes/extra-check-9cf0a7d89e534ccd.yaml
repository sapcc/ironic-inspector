    The ``extra_hardware`` processing hook no longer refuses to parse extra

    The previous behavior can be returned by setting the new option
    ``[extra_hardware]strict`` to ``True``.

    The previous behavior can be returned by setting the new option
    ``[extra_hardware]strict`` to ``True``.
