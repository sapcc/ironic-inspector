    By default the DHCP filtering will open the DHCP server for any node when
    introspection is active. It will only block DHCP for enrolled nodes that
    are not being introspected. Doing so is required to support interface
    discovery (which by default will enroll the pxe port to ironic if not
    present). This behaviour is not always wanted, as nodes not managed by
    ironic may boot the inspection image.

    A new option was added ``[pxe_filter]deny_unknown_macs`` which allow
    changeing this behaviour so that the DHCP server only allow enrolled nodes
    being introspected and deny everything else.

    .. Note:: If this option is ``True``, nodes must have at least one
              enrolled port prior to introspection.
