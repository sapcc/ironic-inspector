    Fixes an issue which may occur with Apache httpd webservers acting as a
    proxy where the server may report ``Bad Gateway``, however inspector
    continues operating as if there was no problem. This was due to a
    lack of a ``Content-Type`` header on HTTP 202 and 204 replies,
    and lack of message body with HTTP 202 messages which Apache httpd
    can error upon.
