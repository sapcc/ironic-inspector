    Allows splitting the ironic-inspector service into ironic-inspector-api and
    ironic-inspector-conductor which coordinate via tooz and its underlying
    backend. A new configuration option ``[DEFAULT]standalone`` is introduced
    to enable this feature. The configuration defaults to True, and
    ironic-inspector runs as a single service, which is compatible with the
    old behavior. When set to False, ``ironic-inspector-api-wsgi`` is used to
    start the API service, and ``ironic-inspector-conductor`` is used to start
    the conductor service. For ironic-inspector running in non-standalone
    mode, the user needs to set the new configuration option
    ``[coordination]backend_url``, which specifies the backend used for
    coordination.
