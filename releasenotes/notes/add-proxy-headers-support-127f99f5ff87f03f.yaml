    Adds a possibility to setup ironic inspector behind a proxy, while
    allowing the links of the resources API returns to remain correct.
    Inspector now respects the following headers that are passed with
    API requests: ``X-Forwarded-For``, ``X-Forwarded-Proto``,
    ``X-Forwarded-Host``, ``X-Forwarded-Port``, ``X-Forwarded-Prefix``.
    If the API is run providing ``SCRIPT_NAME`` environment variable,
    it is now also respected, and it allows to return the correct links
    in response to requests, even if inspector API is not placed at the
    web server root resource.
