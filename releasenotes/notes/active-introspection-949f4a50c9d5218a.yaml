    Adds the capability for introspection data to be posted to the API
    when a baremetal node is in ``active`` or ``rescue`` states. This
    feature may be useful for data center operators who wish to update
    introspection data periodically.

    To enable this feature, set ``[processing]permit_active_introspection``
    to ``True``. When this is set, the value of ``[processing]power_off`` is
    overridden for nodes in ``active`` or ``rescue`` states.
