    Fixes the node identification logic to enable a user to list
    the ``redfish_address`` label for ``driver_info`` field values for
    identification of a machine using the ``[DEFAULT]ipmi_address_fields``
    configuration option. Previously the host would just not be matched as
    the full URL would be evaluated instead of what the URL may resolve to.
