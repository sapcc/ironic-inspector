    Adds the ability for periodic clean-up and synchronization tasks with
    ``ironic`` to be able to be disabled by setting the
    ``[DEFAULT]clean_up_period`` to a value of ``0``. This is intended for
    "stand-alone" operators only as it may result in unexpected behaviors if
    used in a non-standalone environment.
